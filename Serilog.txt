IOptions<T>
-------------
When using this, the values will always be same for the lifetime of the application.
Changing the value of the appsettings file while the application is running will not
make any difference to the value when using IOptions. In other words it is in Singleton scope.

IOptionsSnapshot<T>
--------------------
Using this will always give you the most up to date values in your config file for 
every request and will remain the same for the during of your request.

IOptionsMonitor<T>
-------------------
Using the monitor is almost like having real time access to your settings file.
Each time you need the value from the config, it will read it and evaluate whatever is there and return that.

The IOptions service is used to bind strongly types options class to configuration section and registers it to the Asp.Net Core Dependency Injection Service Container
